**CyberGuardian AI** is a web application that provides a compelling demonstration of how a web vulnerability scanner operates. By accepting a target URL, it simulates the process of scanning and presents a report of potential security weaknesses in a clear and understandable format. **Please note that this is a simulated scanner and does not perform actual in-depth security analysis.** It serves as an educational tool and a visual representation of vulnerability scanning concepts.

## ‚ú® Key Features

* **Intuitive User Interface:** A clean and modern web interface allows users to easily input target URLs.
* **Simulated Scanning Process:** A visual loading animation provides feedback, mimicking the time a real scan might take.
* **Detailed Mock Vulnerability Reports:** Presents simulated findings with clear names, severity levels, descriptions, and suggested remediation steps.
* **Visually Engaging Presentation:** Utilizes modern CSS styling to create an appealing and informative user experience.
* **Client-Side Interaction:** Dynamic updates to the page using JavaScript to display scan results without full page reloads.
* **Backend Powered by Flask:** A lightweight Python framework handles the "scanning" logic and serves the vulnerability data.
* **Security Headers:** Demonstrates basic security best practices by including security-related HTTP headers in the server responses.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these simple steps to run CyberGuardian AI locally:

### Prerequisites

* **Python 3.6+:** Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* **pip:** Python package installer (usually included with Python installations).

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository** (if you have the files in a repository):
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd cyberguardian-ai
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the project directory** (if you've downloaded the files directly):
    ```bash
    cd <directory-containing-files>
    ```

3.  **Install Flask and Flask-CORS:**
    ```bash
    pip install Flask Flask-CORS
    ```

### Running the Application

1.  **Run the Flask development server:**
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

2.  **Open your web browser** and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.

3.  **Enter a URL** in the provided input field and click the "Scan" button to see the simulated results.

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works (Simplified)

1.  **User Input:** The user enters a website URL into the form on the `index.html` page.
2.  **Frontend Request:** `script.js` sends an asynchronous request (AJAX) to the `/scan` endpoint on the backend (`app.py`) with the provided URL.
3.  **Simulated Backend Processing:** The Flask application receives the URL, simulates a scanning delay using `time.sleep(2)`, and then returns a predefined list of mock vulnerabilities as a JSON response.
4.  **Frontend Rendering:** `script.js` receives the JSON response and dynamically updates the `index.html` page to display the vulnerability information in a user-friendly table.
5.  **Styling:** `styles.css` provides the visual styling for all elements, ensuring a clean and professional presentation.
